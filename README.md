# PsychedelicDrumKit

A simple visual drumKit application. 
I am using it to further explore Haskell and more specifically the Graphics.Gloss library and it's implemintations. 
Working on this project introduces me to newer and more basic problems with game design, the Gloss Library,
and modular programming in general.

## Current Problems
  * Dealing with BMP files and their backgrounds
  * Modularizing the stack like result of the pictures function
